                <h2>Metaphor: Nora Lives Like a Doll</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="text">
                    Just as the title suggests, Ibsen uses a metaphorical doll in order to explain how Nora was treated by the important men in 
                    her life. She felt as though she was initially her father's doll-child, and was passed on to Helmer to be his doll-wife. 
                    Though this means that she frequently gets pampered, like a doll should, Nora was also expected to follow every and all 
                    instructions she was given. Both characters were fond of Nora solely because of their ability to control her.

                <h2>Symbolism: The Christmas Tree</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="text">
                    Symbolism of what Nora is to Helmer is shown through the existence of the Christmas tree. A Christmas tree is a form of 
                    festive decoration, symbolizing Nora as a decoration for Helmer to decorate, dress up, and show off to others. In the 
                    beginning of the play, Nora tells the maids to hide the Christmas tree away from the children, another symbolism made to show 
                    how Helmer refuses to let anyone see Nora in her dress before the night of the tarantella. The Christmas tree showed a 
                    parallel symbolism to what Nora experiences.

                <h2>Diction: Helmer's Pet Names for Nora</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="text">
                    Ibsen uses a certain diction in Helmer's lines to show his manipulative behavior. Within Helmer's lines, he often refers to 
                    Nora with pet names such as little skylark and little squirrel, which are used to show how he treats Nora like an immature and 
                    naive child. Meanwhile he calls her a spendthrift as a way to show power and dominance over her.
