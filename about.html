                    Henrik Ibsen, a Norwegian playwright, is the author of the translated drama <em>A Doll's House</em>. Though Ibsen is known 
                    mostly for the writing of his discordant plays, he has also directed several of them in both Bergen and Norway. Other than 
                    <em>A Doll's House</em>, his well known works include <em>Peer Gynt</em> and <em>Hedda Gabler</em>.
                </p>
                <p class="text">Ibsen was born on March 20, 1828, in Skien, Norway. His father worked as a general merchant who unfortunately went 
                    bankrupt when Ibsen was eight. As there was no hope of redeeming his family's misfortunes, Ibsen moved to Grimstad at the age 
                    of 15. There, he supported himself by being an apothecary's apprentice during the day, and studied for his university 
                    admissions by night. Ibsen then took an interest in writing plays during his short moments of leisure.

                <h2>About the Book</h2>

                <p class="text">
                    Ibsen's muse for <em>A Doll's House</em> was his protege and close friend, Laura Kieler. Putting marriage aside, Kieler was to 
                    Ibsen as Nora was to Helmer. Kieler was in grave need of money as she was heavy in debt to a lender. She had previously 
                    borrowed money to finance her husband's medical trip to Italy, but could not ask her husband to help pay off what she owed 
                    because of his irrational fear of being in debt. As Kieler was a writer herself, she threw together a couple poor written novels 
                    which barely earned her any money. When she realized that she could not earn back the money, she forged a check to pay it off. 
                    Her husband then found out about the said forgery and demanded a judicial separation.
