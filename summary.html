                    <em>A Doll's House</em> talks about the secret that Nora has to keep to herself because of her husband's pride and society's 
                    expectations of women. Helmer, Nora's husband, was previously sick and had to go to Italy to recover. Since the Helmers did not 
                    have plenty of money then, Nora forged her late father's signature in order to get a loan through Krogstad, a colleague of her 
                    husband's. As Krogstad learns that he is about to lose his job, he threatens Nora that he will reveal Nora's crime to Helmer if 
                    she fails to convince Helmer to let Krogstad keep his position at the bank. While Nora tries to convince Helmer, he gets 
                    agitated and asks a maid to deliver Krogstad's letter of dismissal. As Helmer leaves, Doctor Rank arrives and tells Nora about 
                    his oncoming death. He then confesses to Nora that he is in love with her as his last conversation with her.

                    Krogstad arrives at the Helmer household out of anger and blackmails Nora even further. He demands to be rehired at the bank with 
                    a higher position, and since he does not believe that Nora can complete his wishes, he drops a letter informing Helmer of 
                    Nora's forgery. Shortly after Krogstad leaves, Nora cries to Mrs. Linde about her problems. Mrs. Linde comforts Nora by 
                    telling her to stall Helmer from reading his letters while she talks to Krogstad about it. In her uneasy state of mind, Nora 
                    practices the tarantella aggressively and convinces Helmer to practice the dance for the party with her.

                    While the Helmers are at the party, Krogstad and Mrs. Linde reconnects with one another and decides to pursue their romantic 
                    relationship, which prompts Krogstad to demand for his letter back. Mrs. Linde then tells Krogstad to let the letter be as it 
                    will be better for both Nora and Helmer if the truth is out. After the party ends, Helmer starts to read his letters and find 
                    out about Nora's crime. He is in complete anger and proceeds to call Nora unfavorable names. He soon regrets his words and 
                    tries to get Nora back on his side. Nora has had enough of Helmer's manipulation and declares that she wants to learn more 
                    about herself on her own. Finally, she leaves the household once and for all.
