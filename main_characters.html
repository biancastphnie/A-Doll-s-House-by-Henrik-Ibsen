                <h2>Nora Helmer</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="text">
                    Nora, the protagonist of the play, was often regarded as an innocent and naive individual with little to no insight on the 
                    ways of the real world. However, more of her personality is shown as the play goes on. She is willing to rebel against both her 
                    husband's and society's expectations as she realizes the way she has been treated her entire life.
                </p>
                <h2>Torvald Helmer</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="text">
                    Helmer, Nora's husband, though most often seen as an outwardly nice character, is shown to have a manipulative tendency when 
                    it comes to treating his wife. His decisions and emotions are often influenced by how he feels society will accept certain 
                    ideas as he very much cares about his reputation.
                </p>
                <h2>Nils Krogstad</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="text">
                    Krogstad, Helmer's subordinate at the bank, has committed the very same crime that he held Nora accountable for. As Krogstad 
                    was about to lose his position at the bank, he blackmailed Nora to convince her husband to let Krogstad keep his occupation 
                    and threatened to tell Helmer about Nora's act of forgery.
                </p>
                <h2>Christine Linde</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="text">
                    Mrs. Linde, a childhood friend of Nora's, is a logical woman with plenty of knowledge about society and the world. She came to 
                    Nora in search of a job as she feels there is nothing to live for anymore since her husband died. Mrs. Linde has had a rough 
                    life prior to coming to the Helmer household, and has found Nora a good friend to confide in.
                </p>
                <h2>Doctor Rank</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="text">
                    Doctor Rank, a close friend of the Helmers', has an accepting mindset which is shown through his self-announced coming of 
                    death letter which was sent to both of his friends. During the time he was still well enough to interact with people, he was 
                    seen to fancy Nora as more than just a friend and had expressed his feelings for her in one scene.
